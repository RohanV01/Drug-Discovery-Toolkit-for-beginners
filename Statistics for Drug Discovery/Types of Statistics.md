## Types of Statistics

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics involve methods for summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. It provides tools to organize and present data in a meaningful way, helping researchers gain initial insights.

### 2. Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics is concerned with making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample. It allows researchers to draw conclusions beyond the data they have directly observed.


## Examples in Bioinformatics

### Descriptive Statistics Example

In drug discovery, descriptive statistics can be applied in various ways:

#### Example: Molecular Weight Distribution
Suppose we are analyzing a dataset of potential drug compounds. We can calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of the molecular weights to understand the central tendency and variability of the compounds.


### Inferential Statistics Example

Inferential statistics play a crucial role in drug discovery for making predictions and drawing conclusions:

#### Example: Drug Efficacy Comparison
Suppose we have two groups of patients, one receiving Drug A and the other receiving Drug B. We collect data on their response rates to the respective drugs.

## Conclusion

Understanding and applying both descriptive and inferential statistics is crucial in bioinformatics for drug discovery. Descriptive statistics help in summarizing data, while inferential statistics allow us to make informed decisions and draw meaningful conclusions from experimental results.
